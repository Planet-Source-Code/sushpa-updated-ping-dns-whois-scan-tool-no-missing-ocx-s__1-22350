## Updated: Ping, DNS, Whois, Scan tool: no missing OCX's


</div>

### Description

This submission was totally messed up; I'm terribly sorry. I'm awful at handling ZIP files; and am really sorry for not having submitted this release earlier, as I had no Internet access for about a week. Anyway, This project is written afresh, with no external OCX files. This will scan hosts for open ports, and you have the option of scanning only common ports or those that you define. You can carry out WhoIs queries about domain names; Send ping echoes and even specify the datasize and timeout interval. There is DNS support that allows you to resolve hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa. You can log all activities with extended support options like automatic saving. Every action, every port scanned, every host pinged, is recorded in the activity log. New features:

1. Cleared all factors previously requiring OCXs,

2. Much improved activity logging system code,

3. Now even WhoIs responses are logged to file,

4. Better bug-fixes, no crashes while switching tabs.
